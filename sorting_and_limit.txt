⭐Sorting Data 
The ORDER BY command is used to sort the data in a SELECT statement.

The ORDER BY command comes after the table name in the SELECT statement.

By default, ORDER BY sorts the results in ascending order.

We can specify the ordering using the ASC and DESC keywords.

We can also sort the data based on multiple columns.

⭐Limit 
The SELECT statement returns all the rows in the table.

In case we only need a specific number of rows from the table, we can use the LIMIT keyword.

We can combine the LIMIT with ORDER BY.
Remember, the LIMIT keyword has to come after the ORDER BY in the SELECT statement.

We can also select rows starting from an offset.

The first row has the offset 0, which is why OFFSET 2 will start from the 3rd row in the 
result.
