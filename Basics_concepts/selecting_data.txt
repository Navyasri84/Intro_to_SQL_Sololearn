⭐Selecting Data 
The SELECT statement is used to select data from a table.
SELECT * FROM Customers

* selects all columns of the table.

Instead of *, we can specify a column that we want to select.
SELECT City FROM Customers

We can specify multiple columns in the SELECT statement by separating them with commas.
SELECT firstname, lastname FROM Customers 

⭐SQL Syntax 
You can run multiple SQL queries, by separating them with semicolons.
SELECT firstname, lastname
  FROM Customers;

SELECT firstname, city, age
  FROM Customers; 

SQL queries are also often broken down into multiple lines, to make them more readable. 
This is possible, because newlines and whitespaces are ignored.

⭐Case Sensitivity 
SQL is case insensitive.
select city from Customers;
SELECT City FROM Customers;
sElEct ciTY From Customers;
