⭐Duplicate Values 
In some cases we might get duplicate values in the results.
SELECT city FROM Customers 

We can remove the duplicates using the DISTINCT keyword.
SELECT DISTINCT city 
FROM Customers 

The DISTINCT keyword is placed before the column name we want to select.
SELECT DISTINCT city from Customers
ORDER BY city ASC 

⭐Example 
Let's use everything we learned so far to create a query.

We want to select the firstname and lastname of the customer with the largest age value.

For that, we can select the top 1 record of our table ordered by the age column in descending order:

SELECT firstname, lastname FROM Customers
ORDER BY age DESC
LIMIT 1
