⭐Sorting Data 
The ORDER BY command is used to sort the data in a SELECT statement.
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY firstname

The ORDER BY command comes after the table name in the SELECT statement.

By default, ORDER BY sorts the results in ascending order.

We can specify the ordering using the ASC and DESC keywords.
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY firstname DESC

We can also sort the data based on multiple columns.
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY city ASC, lastname DESC 

⭐Limit 
The SELECT statement returns all the rows in the table.
SELECT * FROM Customers
LIMIT 3 

In case we only need a specific number of rows from the table, we can use the LIMIT keyword.

We can combine the LIMIT with ORDER BY.
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY city DESC
LIMIT 3

Remember, the LIMIT keyword has to come after the ORDER BY in the SELECT statement.

We can also select rows starting from an offset.
SELECT * FROM Customers
ORDER BY city DESC
LIMIT 3 OFFSET 2  

The first row has the offset 0, which is why OFFSET 2 will start from the 3rd row in the 
result.
