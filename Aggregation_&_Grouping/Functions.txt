‚≠êFunctions 
SQL supports many useful functions that we can use to perform calculations and manipulations.

For example, the COUNT() function is used to return the number of records of a select statement:

SELECT COUNT(*) 
FROM Customers

This will return the number of rows in the table.

Note that the function is called with parentheses after its name, containing the function parameter, in this 
case, the column name.


We can also call the COUNT() function for a specific column. 

For example, let's select the number of DISTINCT cities:

SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT city)
FROM Customers

This will select the number of unique city names from the table.


Another useful function is SUM().

It returns the sum of the values in a column.

For the demo, we have added a salary column to our Customers table, instead of the age column.

Let's calculate the sum of all salary values in our table:

SELECT SUM(salary) 
FROM Customers

NULL values are simply ignored.

If you try to SUM() a text column, the result will be 0.

SUM() of NULLs is NULL.


Similar to a SELECT statement, we can define a condition for our sum.

For example, let's sum only the salaries of the Customers from New York:

SELECT SUM(salary)
FROM Customers
WHERE city = 'New York'  


The AVG() function returns the average value of a numeric column.

For example:

SELECT AVG(salary)
FROM Customers 

This will result in the average salary of our data.


MIN() and MAX() are used to return the minimum and maximum value of a column:

SELECT MIN(salary)
FROM Customers; 

SELECT MAX(salary) 
FROM Customers;
