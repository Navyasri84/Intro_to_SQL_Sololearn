‚≠êCustom Columns 
Functions allow you to create new columns in the result table of the SELECT statement.

For example, the UPPER() function can be used to convert text to uppercase.

Let's apply it on our firstname column:

SELECT UPPER(firstname) 
FROM Customers 

The result is a new column, which has the function as its name.


We can provide a new name for the column with the AS keyword:

SELECT UPPER(firstname) AS Name
FROM Customers 


Custom Columns 
We can also create new columns by applying mathematical operations.

For example, let's select the first names and the salary column multiplied by 12:

SELECT UPPER(firstname) AS Name,
salary*12 AS Annual_Salary
FROM Customers 

You can create as many custom columns as you need.

If the new column name includes spaces, it needs to be enclosed in single quotes.
