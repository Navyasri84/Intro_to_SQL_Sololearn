⭐Updating Data 
The UPDATE statement allows you to change values in a table.

For example:

UPDATE Customers
SET salary = 9900
WHERE id = 2

This will update the salary column to the given value for the row with id = 2.

You can specify any condition in the WHERE, similar to the SELECT statement.


⭐All rows meeting the given condition will get updated.

So if you omit the WHERE clause, all records in the table will be updated!

For example:

UPDATE Customers
SET salary = 9900 

This will change the salary value for all rows in the table.


⭐It is also possible to UPDATE multiple columns at the same time by comma-separating them:

For example:

UPDATE Customers
SET salary = 9900,
city = 'New York'
WHERE ID = 2
