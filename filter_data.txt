⭐The following comparison operators can be used in the WHERE condition:
> greater than
< less than
>= greater or equal
<= less or equal
Eg,
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE age <= 42 

⭐Equality 
To check for equality, the equal to operator = can be used
Eg,
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE age = 42 

⭐Text Values 
To compare with a text value, put the text value in single quotes.
Eg,
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE firstname = 'James' 

In case the value includes a single quote, (for example let's), use two single quotes: 
'let''s'

⭐Not Equal 
The not equal operator is <>
Eg,
SELECT * FROM Customers 
WHERE age <> 42 

In some SQL versions, the != operator is the equivalent to <>.

⭐BETWEEN 
The BETWEEN operator can be used to select rows that are in a range of values.
Eg,
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE age 
BETWEEN 30 AND 50
