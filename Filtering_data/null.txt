‚≠êNULL 
NULL is the absence of value.

This means that any field in our table with no value with have the value NULL. 

NULL is different from a zero or a space. It is the value that corresponds to a blank value. 

To check for NULL values the IS NULL operator can be used.

For example:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE age IS NULL 

This will return only those rows that have their age as NULL.

Similarly, we can check for non-null values using IS NOT NULL:
SELECT * FROM Customers 
WHERE age IS NOT NULL
