⭐Logical Operators 
Conditions in the WHERE command can be combined using logical operators.

The AND operator combines two conditions and is satisfied if both conditions are satisfied.

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE age >= 42 AND age <= 60  

You can combine as many conditions as you need.

⭐OR 
Similarly, the OR operator is satisfied if any one of its conditions holds.

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE city = 'New York' OR city = 'Chicago' 

⭐IN 
Instead of multiple OR conditions for a single column, the IN operator can be used.

The previous example can be written as following:
SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE city IN ('New York', 'Chicago')  

The values for the IN operator need to be in parentheses, separated by commas.

⭐NOT 
The NOT IN operator allows you to exclude a list of specific values from the result set.  

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE city NOT IN ('New York', 'Chicago')  

This will select only the rows that don't have any of the given values for their city 
column.

⭐Multiple Conditions 
We can combine multiple conditions using the logical operators and group them using 
parentheses.

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE city = 'New York' AND
(age > 30 OR age = 24)

When combining conditions, it is important to use parentheses, so that the order to 
evaluate each condition is known.
