⭐Subqueries 
We can use the query from the previous part inside another query, like this:

SELECT * 
FROM Customers
WHERE salary > (
   SELECT 
   AVG(salary)
   FROM Customers
) 

As you can see, we used a query inside the condition.

Remember, subqueries need to be enclosed in parentheses.


Similarly, a subquery can be used with an IN.

Consider a second table called Cities that includes city names.

We need to select the customers that are from one of these cities:

SELECT * FROM Customers
WHERE city IN (
  SELECT name 
  FROM Cities
) 


We can also use subqueries in the SELECT column list.

For example, let's make a new column with the average salary next to each row of our table:

SELECT *, (SELECT AVG(salary)
FROM Customers) AS Average
FROM Customers 

As you can see, we can use subqueries to create a new column, as well as create conditions in the WHERE 
statement.
