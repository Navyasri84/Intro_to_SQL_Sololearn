⭐Create Table 
A SQL database can contain hundreds of tables. 

Creating a basic table involves naming the table and defining its columns and each column's data type.


⭐Data Types 
Table columns are responsible for storing many different types of data, including numbers, texts, dates, and even files. 

Here are the names of the most common data types:

INT - whole number
FLOAT - floating point number
DOUBLE - A double precision floating-point number.
DATE - A date in YYYY-MM-DD format.
DATETIME - A date and time combination in YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS format.
TIMESTAMP - A timestamp, calculated from midnight, January 1, 1970
TIME - Stores the time in HH:MM:SS format.
VARCHAR(M) - Variable-length character string. Max size is specified in parenthesis.
TEXT - Large amount of text data. 

It is important to set the correct data type of the columns when creating the table. 


⭐Create Table 
Here is an example create command for our Customers table:

CREATE TABLE Customers (
  id INT,
  firstname VARCHAR(128),
lastname VARCHAR(128),
  salary INT,
  city VARCHAR(128)
);

As you can see, each column has a name and data type.

They are separated by commas.

The CREATE TABLE command defined the table name and the columns list in parentheses.


⭐Default Values 
A column can also have a default value, which is applied to the rows when no value is provided for it.

It is defined using the DEFAULT keyword:

CREATE TABLE Customers (
id INT,
firstname VARCHAR(128),
lastname VARCHAR(128),
salary INT DEFAULT 0,
city VARCHAR(128)
); 

Now, the salary column has a default value of 0.

You can provide default values for multiple columns.


⭐NULL 
We can also specify if a column can or cannot have NULL values.

For example, let's define the firstname column to be non-null:

CREATE TABLE Customers (
id INT,
firstname VARCHAR(128) NOT NULL,
lastname VARCHAR(128),
salary INT DEFAULT 0,
city VARCHAR(128)
); 

Now, when inserting data into the table, the firstname column has to have a value.
