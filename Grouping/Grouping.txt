‚≠êGrouping 
SQL allows to group records using the GROUP BY clause.

For example, let's select the number of customers from each city in our table.

SELECT city, COUNT(*)
FROM Customers
GROUP BY city  

This query will return the number of customers in each city, as well as the city name.

 
We can also order the results by the COUNT column:

SELECT city, COUNT(*) AS c
FROM Customers
GROUP BY city
ORDER BY c ASC

Grouping is used with aggregate functions, which are applied to each group.


When using the GROUP BY, we select only the column that we group by, and aggregate functions which apply to the groups.

The other columns cannot be selected, as only one row per group is returned.
