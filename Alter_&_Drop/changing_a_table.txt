‚≠êChanging a Table 
The ALTER TABLE command is used to add, delete, or modify columns in an existing table.

For example, let's add a new column to our Customers table:

ALTER TABLE Customers
ADD age INT 

All rows will have the default value in the newly added column, which in this case is NULL.
