⭐Selecting Data 
The SELECT statement is used to select data from a table.

* selects all columns of the table.

Instead of *, we can specify a column that we want to select.

We can specify multiple columns in the SELECT statement by separating them with commas.

⭐SQL Syntax 
You can run multiple SQL queries, by separating them with semicolons.

SQL queries are also often broken down into multiple lines, to make them more readable. 
This is possible, because newlines and whitespaces are ignored.

⭐Case Sensitivity 
SQL is case insensitive.
